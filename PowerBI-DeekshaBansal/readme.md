Sustainability Data Analysis Dashboard
Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of sustainability-related data, focusing on water usage, energy consumption, CO2 emissions by material, and product sales by date and region. It is designed to offer insights into the environmental impact of different materials and the geographic distribution of product sales.

Dashboard Features
1. Water Usage, Energy Consumption, and CO2 Emissions by Material
Visual Type: Stacked Column Chart
Description: This visualization displays the water usage, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions for various materials such as Mycelium, Bacterial Cellulose, Mushroom Leather, Cotton, and more. Each material is analyzed for its impact on sustainability, helping to identify the most and least sustainable options.
2. Product Sold by Date
Visual Type: Bar Chart
Description: This chart tracks the quantity of different products sold over a specified date range. Users can filter by date using the date slicer at the top of the dashboard to view sales trends for specific periods.
3. Product Sold by Territories
Visual Type: Map with Pie Charts
Description: This map visualization provides a geographic overview of product sales across different territories (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia). Each region is represented by a pie chart that breaks down the types of products sold, such as Hats, Jackets, Jeans, Shoes, and T-Shirts.
Data Sources
Materials Impact Data: Data includes metrics on water usage, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions for various materials.
