All the files in the `PowerBI` folder have been created and worked on by **Iswarya Gudala**.

1. **Database Creation**:
   - A database was created to store and manage the dataset using MySql.
   - The database connection was established using Python to facilitate data extraction.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Data was extracted from the database and cleaned using Python.
   - Various data preprocessing techniques were applied to ensure the data was ready for analysis.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Cleaned data was imported into PowerBI.
   - Multiple visualizations were created to represent the data effectively, enabling a deeper understanding of the trends and insights within the dataset.
4. **Data Visualization using Python**
- In addition to PowerBI, visualizations were also created using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- These Python visualizations complement the PowerBI visualizations and provide additional insights.

This project showcases the end-to-end process of data handling, from database creation to final visualizations. The use of both PowerBI and Python for visualization highlights the versatility and capability of these tools in data analysis.
